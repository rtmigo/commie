# AG 2021: in pypi/comment_parser this module was only for parsing JavaScript.
# But in fact, it coped better with parsing C than old regex-based c_parser.py.
# So for now it is the default parsed for all C-like languages.
#
# The most evident difference between JS and C in that single quotes can
# contain a string in JS, but in C and C++ they are only for single chars.
# However, for the task, individual characters within single quotes are
# hardly different from single-letter strings.
#
# The parser for Go now also relies on the following code. In fact, the only
# key differnce in Go parsed was `backquoted strings` support
