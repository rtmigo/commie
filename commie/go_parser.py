def extract_comments(goCode: str) -> Iterable[Comment]:
  """Extracts a list of comments from the given Go source code.

  Comments are represented with the Comment class found in the common module.
  Go comments come in two forms, single and multi-line comments.
    - Single-line comments begin with '//' and continue to the end of line.
    - Multi-line comments begin with '/*' and end with '*/' and can span
      multiple lines of code. If a multi-line comment does not terminate
      before EOF is reached, then an exception is raised.
  Go comments are not allowed to start in a string or rune literal. This
  module makes sure to watch out for those.

  https://golang.org/ref/spec#Comments

  Args:
    goCode: String containing code to extract comments from.
  Returns:
    Python list of common.Comment in the order that they appear in the code.
  Raises:
    common.UnterminatedCommentError: Encountered an unterminated multi-line
      comment.
